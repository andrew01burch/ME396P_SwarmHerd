# ME396P_SwarmHerd

This is the Final Project for Team G07 in ME396P Fall 2023.

Team members consist of Andrew Burch, Carl Stott, and Tyler Cronin.

This project aims to design and implement a simulated swarm of robot agents that employ neural networks to adaptively learn cooperative behaviors. By integrating swarm intelligence algorithms, the project aims to train the swarm to perform tasks such as object transport, exploration, and area coverage efficiently and autonomously.

Main problem: Implement adaptive learning mechanisms to accomplish cooperation out of multiple entities without a centralized controller.

Additionally, we may expand into looking at constrained agents for additional uniqueness.
